# Maintenance checklist

**Software leadership should get through the majority of updates each summer, before the offseason gets underway.**

## Routine updates
- [ ] Update WPILib version
- [ ] Update vendordeps
- [ ] Update usage of libraries like Choreo, PhotonVision, etc. in both explanations + example code
- [ ] Update WPILib usage (e.g. Commands syntax)
- [ ] Clean up branches from the adding names exercise
- [ ] Check for link rot (and please permalink when you can, especially GitHub repos)
- [ ] Replace links to code examples with newer/better examples (as needed)

## 8033 specific
- [ ] Update the [Electronics crash course](Docs/2_Architecture/2.2_ElectronicsCrashCourse.md). Generally, try not to remove anything, but note devices we've moved towards or away from.
- [ ] Update examples to reflect best practices for code organization and structure. This is sort of nebulous, but something like no AKit --> AKit, or no superstructure --> superstructure would warrant an update
- [ ] Any specific feedback you have received this year
- [ ] For 2027: Update with roboRIO --> SystemCore transition info
