# Kitbot Code Tutorial

## Intro

### What is a kitbot?

![AM14U4 or Kitbot Chassis](../../Assets/Kitbot.jpg)

The kitbot is a drivetrain which comes in the Kit of Parts provided by FIRST as part of registration.
It is a typical example of a differential drivetrain.
That name comes from the fact that the amount it turns is equal to the difference between the speed of the left and right sides.
This type of drive is also known as skid-steer or tank drive.

### Why kitbot?

We do not use the kitbot or other differential drive for our robots in competition.
Instead, we use a much more versatile swerve drive.
However, the code for a swerve drive is much more complex than a tank drive.
The kitbot has somewhat standard dimensions, gearboxes, wheels, and other physical characteristics, so it makes for a good exercise to introduce you to programming FRC robots.

### So what do we need to program?

Inputs/Outputs:

- A command that takes in velocity and rotational velocity, and outputs the correct wheel speeds to meet that.

Electronics:

- Each side of the chassis has two Kraken X60 motors, which will work together to power the left and right sides of the chassis.
  In code this will look like a total of 4 Talon FX motor controllers, which is the component we can talk to.

## Code Walkthrough

If you think you can figure out how to program this on your own, go for it!
However, check your work against this to see if you did it the same way.
If you have any questions about why we did it this way, ask a lead.

To start, open up WPILib vscode and create a new project.

![A screenshot of wpilib vscode showing where to press to create a new project](../../Assets/KitbotScreenshot0.png)

Select `Template`, `Java`, `Command Robot Skeleton (Advanced)` as the template for your project.
Select whichever folder you want and title the project something along the lines of "Kitbot Example".
Set the team to 8033.
Make sure to enable desktop support, since it's necessary for simulation work which we will do on this project down the line.

Once you've created your project, open the src\main\java\frc\robot folder.
In this folder, create a new folder "Subsystems".

![A screenshot of the file tree of the project](../../Assets/KitbotScreenshot2.png)

In that folder, right click and then click "create a new class/command"

![A screenshot of the context menu to create a new class/command](../../Assets/KitbotScreenshot3.png)

Select Subsystem and name it `DrivetrainSubsystem`. 
This file is the subsystem file for the kitbot drivetrain.
It will contain all of the hardware that the drivetrain uses, which in this case are TalonFX motor controllers.
Other subsystems will contain sensors, solenoids, and more.
It will also contain methods that we use to interact with the subsystem from the rest of our code.

Our team names subsystem files using the "NameSubsystem" convention.
That means that our file should end in Subsystem, so it's clear what it is.
The name should also be reasonably short and descriptive.
`IntakeSubsystem` is a good name.
`GreybotsGrabberSubsystem` is too long, and `CircleThingySubsystem` is not specific.

Make sure this class extends `SubsystemBase`.
This is needed to make sure that it is treated as a Subsystem where only one Command can use it at a time.

```Java
public class DrivetrainSubsystem extends SubsystemBase {}
```

In this subsystem file we will need to add our hardware.
But to have access to the API for our motors, we need to install the CTRE Phoenix library.
Use the instructions [here](https://pro.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/docs/installation/installation-frc.html) to install the API.
Make sure to get the V6 API.
For this project you may use the online installer, but if you want to use your computer to run and setup the robot it is useful to have Tuner X installed.
The [api docs](https://pro.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/docs/api-reference/index.html) for CTRE are also on the same website.

Once you have installed the vendor library, create two TalonFX objects in your subsystem called `leftFalcon` and `rightFalcon`.
By convention, hardware should have a succinct, descriptive name followed by the type of hardware it is.

```Java
TalonFX leftFalcon = new TalonFX(0);
TalonFX rightFalcon = new TalonFX(0);

/** Creates a new Drivetrain. */
public DrivetrainSubsystem() {}
```

The number being passed into the constructor for the TalonFXs is the ID number of the motor, which we set using Tuner.
Since we don't have real hardware for this example this number is arbitrary, but it's good practice to have these sorts of constants defined at the top of the file.

In Constants.java add two `public static final int`s, one for the left motor's ID and one for the right motor.
By putting these configuration values all in one place we can easily change them if hardware changes.

```Java
public class DrivetrainSubsystem extends SubsystemBase {
  public static final int drivetrainLeftFalconID = 0;
  public static final int drivetrainRightFalconID = 1;

  TalonFX leftFalcon = new TalonFX(drivetrainLeftFalconID);
  TalonFX rightFalcon = new TalonFX(drivetrainRightFalconID);
  //...
}
```
Then change DrivetrainSubsystem to use the new constants.

Next, let's add the `ControlRequest` objects.
These represent the output of a device, such as a desired voltage, velocity, position, etc.
In CTRE's v6 API, we set the output of a motor by passing it a subclass of `ControlRequest` like `VoltageOut` or `PositionDutyCycle`.
Below the Talons, add two `VoltageOut`s.
The constructor for these takes in a default voltage, which we can set to 0 to avoid any nasty surprises when we turn the robot on.
Make sure you import these classes.
You can do this by hovering over the red underlined code, hitting "quick fix", and pressing "import . . .".

```Java
TalonFX leftFalcon = new TalonFX(Constants.drivetrainLeftFalconID);
TalonFX rightFalcon = new TalonFX(Constants.drivetrainRightFalconID);

VoltageOut leftVoltage = new VoltageOut(0);
VoltageOut rightVoltage = new VoltageOut(0);

/** Creates a new Drivetrain. */
public DrivetrainSubsystem() {}
```

We have the control requests now, but we need a way to set them.
Lets add a method for this.

```Java
private void setVoltages(double left, double right) {
    leftFalcon.setControl(leftVoltage.withOutput(left));
    rightFalcon.setControl(rightVoltage.withOutput(left));
}
```

You might notice that this method is private.
This is because whenever we want to interact with the hardware of a subsystem we should go through a Command, which guarantees that each piece of hardware is only requested to do one thing at a time.
To do this we need to make a Command factory method, or a method that returns a `Command`.

```Java
public Command setVoltagesCommand(DoubleSupplier left, DoubleSupplier right) {
  return this.run(() -> this.setVoltages(left.getAsDouble(), right.getAsDouble()));
}
```

Notice how instead of passing in `double`s, we pass in `DoubleSupplier`s.
A `DoubleSupplier` is just any function that returns a `double`.
This function could always return the same value, effectively acting like a double, or it can get its value some other way.
This lets us use this command to drive the robot with joysticks, an autonomous controller, or other input that may change.

In the body of the method we return `this.run()`, which implicitly creates a `RunCommand`.
`RunCommand` is a subtype of Command, and represents a Command which runs a single function over and over again.
This function is defined using lambda syntax, or the `() ->` symbol.
On the right of the arrow is a call to our `setVoltages()` method, which calls our `DoubleSupplier`s which each return a value each call of the function, in this case every 20ms as part of the Command loop.

We might not want to drive the robot just by setting the left and right wheel speeds, however.
Let's add a method that uses a desired forwards/backwards and turning velocity to set the wheel speeds.
We can do this using WPILib's `DifferentialDrive` class.

```Java
public Command setVoltagesArcadeCommand(DoubleSupplier drive, DoubleSupplier steer) {
  return this.run(() -> {
    var speeds = DifferentialDrive.arcadeDriveIK(drive.getAsDouble(), steer.getAsDouble(), false);
    this.setVoltages(speeds.left * 12, speeds.right * 12);
  });
}
```
This method has a very similar structure to the previous method.
The main difference is that instead of having one method in our lambda (`() ->`), we have a code block ({} block).
This means we need to end each line with a ; but can use multiple lines in our Command.

This method is named `setVoltagesArcadeCommand` after the arcade drive control it uses, or one input for driving speed and one for turning speed.
Arcade drive isn't the only option we have for "useful units" for a drivetrain.
Curvature drive is another example which tries to emulate a car by only turning when forward motion is happening.
On a real robot what we use would come down to driver preference.

The "IK" stands for "Inverse Kinematics", a fancy term for a bit of math to convert from the desired driving and turning speed to the needed wheel speeds.
More generally, IK lets us convert from useful units, like an arm's position in space or a drivetrain's speed in each direction, to ones we can directly use, like motor speeds or positions.
In this case, we call `arcadeDriveIK` from WPILib's `DifferentialDrive` class and store the result in a variable called `speeds`.

Then we pass `speeds` to the drive method.
However, there's a catch to these speeds.
Because WPILib's `DifferentialDrive` class doesn't know what kind of motors we run or what voltage our robot is at, it gives us motor speeds in the range -1 to 1, where 1 corresponds to full forward output and -1 corresponds to full reverse output.
We can convert to voltage by multiplying by 12, which our robot should nominally be at.

These methods are all well and good on their own, but it would be nice if we had a way to actually use them.
Let's bind them to a joystick.
Go to `RobotContainer.java` and add a `CommandXboxController` object.

```Java
// Create a new Xbox controller on port 0
CommandXboxController controller = new CommandXboxController(0);
```

`CommandXboxController` is a convenience wrapper around a `XboxController` that makes it easy to bind commands to buttons on the controller.
We also need to add an instance of the `DrivetrainSubsystem` to RobotContainer so that we can control it.

```Java
CommandXboxController controller = new CommandXboxController(0);

DrivetrainSubsystem drivetrainSubsystem = new DrivetrainSubsystem();
```

Finally, we can bind the arcade drive command to the joysticks.
To do this, call `setDefaultCommand()` on `drivetrainSubsystem` in RobotContainer's `configureBindings()` method.
This sets a Command that will be run when no other command is using the drivetrain.
Pass in `drivetrainSubsystem.setVoltagesArcadeCommand()` as the default Command.

For the `DoubleSupplier`s to the arcade drive command we can add two lambdas that call `getLeftY()` and `getRightX()` on the controller, which looks at the current joystick values.
This means during each loop that this command is run, it will check the current joystick values and turn them into voltages for the wheels.

This line is a little long now, so break it up into a few lines to keep it readable.

```Java
drivetrainSubsystem.setDefaultCommand(
    drivetrainSubsystem.setVoltagesArcadeCommand(
        controller::getLeftY,
        controller::getRightX));
```

Using the joystick values directly is perfectly fine, but sometimes our driver wants a different feel to the controls.
One common way is to square the inputs to the drivetrain, which reduces the sensitivity of the drivebase at low speeds.

![A graph of the inputs normally, and squared](../../Assets/SqauredVLinearGraph.png)

The red line here is if we directly take the input, and the blue line shows the squared input.

Another is to add a "deadband" where we wont output any voltage if the input is less than some threshold.
This stops the robot from moving if the controllers are very close to but don't perfectly read 0 when they aren't pressed.

![A graph showing the difference between an input with and without a deadband](../../Assets/DeadbandVNotGraph.png)

This graph shows an input without a deadband in red, and one with an exaggerated deadband in blue.
Notice how the graphs overlap outside of the deadband.
Also notice the jump in inputs when the deadband stops applying.
For an exaggerated one like this it would be an issue, but for a real input the deadband is usually small enough that this jump is not significant.

Let's add a function in RobotContainer to modify the joystick inputs.

Create a function that takes in a double and returns a double called `modifyJoystick`.
Let's start by adding the squaring of the input.
To do this, we multiply our input by itself, but in the process we lose the sign of the input.
We can use `Math.signum` to add it back in.

```Java
private double modifyJoystick(double in) {
    return in * in * Math.signum(in);
}
```

Then lets add the deadband.
If the absolute value of `in` is less than 0.05 (as an example) then return 0.

```Java
private double modifyJoystick(double in) {
    if (Math.abs(in) < 0.05) {
      return 0;
    }
    return in * in * Math.signum(in);
}
```

Now we can add this method into our drive command.

```Java
drivetrainSubsystem.setDefaultCommand(
      drivetrainSubsystem.setVoltagesArcadeCommand(
        () -> modifyJoystick(controller.getLeftY()),
        () -> modifyJoystick(controller.getRightX())));
```

Congratulations!
This code is everything you need for a basic kitbot to drive with arcade controls.
There are plenty of improvements that can be made to this program, such as adding autonomous control or closed loop driving.
Several of those changes you will make to this program over the next couple of courses.
