# Git Workflow

## Pull requests and other organization practices are crucial to write maintainable, clean code

A pull request (PR) is a way to get review on changes before merging them to the main branch.
A more accurate name might be "Merge Review".
To make a pull request, first you need to have changes to merge.
These changes should be on their own, well named branch.
Then go to the pull requests tab on the github repo and hit `new pull request`.
You should be prompted to compare a branch with main.
Select the branch you want to merge.
You should see a list of changes and a green button that says `Create pull request`.
Click that button and then let a software lead or mentor know that you need review.

Another feature of github is issues.
issues are a way to track features that we want to add and problems we need to fix in the repository.
Issues can be created by going to the issues tab of the repository on github and clicking `New issue`.
PRs can be linked to issues to show that an issue has been worked on and automatically resolve the issue when the PR is merged.
